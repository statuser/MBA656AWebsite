  <h2 class="section-header" style="">Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
  <div class="section-body" style="padding: 0 10px 10px 10px;border: solid #ccc 1px;overflow: hidden">
    <p>Rock, paper, scissors is a classic game that has been used to decide everything form multi-million dollar investments to who gets the front seat.  You assignment is to create a computer opponent to play rock, paper, scissors against.  This program will need to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Randomly select either rock, paper, or scissors</li>
      <li>Wait for the player to input their selection</li>
		<li>Verify that the users selection is valid</li>
		<li>Determine if there is a tie and if there is restart the game</li>
		<li>Announce what each participant threw and who the winner is.</li>
    </ul>
	<p>Remember that for this introductory class you can assume users will not intentionally try to break the rules and as such do not need to make extensive input checks.</p>
	  <p>Sample output for the program looks like:
	  </p>
<pre>
	  <code>
	  Hello, let's play Rock, Paper, Scissors!
	  I have picked my hand.
	  Please type in "rock", "paper", or "scissors" to select your hand?
	  **User types in**rock
	  I selected paper, I win!
	  </code>
	  </pre>
	  
	<p>There are likely many solutions available online and even in the book I recommended.  Please try to complete the assignment without looking up the solution online.  This might take you a couple of hours to figure out which is why I'm spreading the assignment over two class periods.</p>
	<p>I would recommend that you start by writing psuedo-code to solve the problem and then revising your psuedo-code to convert it into actual Python code.  This will separate the logic of the game from the programming syntax and should make the assignment much easier.</p>
	<p>There is one thing that you will need to use that we haven't talked about yet.  This is the randint() function from the module random.  This will generate a random integer that you can convert into the choice for the computer.  To get you started here is the code that we haven't yet talked about that you will need:
	</p>
<pre>
	<code>
	import random 
	# Random is a module that contains code written by the python developers to help 
	# generating random numbers.  We will talk more about modules later, but there
	# are many modules that have been written that can simplify many tasks.  Much
	# of your programming will just be using code that others have written by
	# importing modules and calling functions.
	
	computer_choice = random.randint(0,2)
	# This line calls the function randint from the module random and stores the 
	# result as computer choice.  The function randint(start_number, end_number) 
	# generates a random integer between start_number and end_number including 
	# the end points. Programmers like to start counting at 0 instead of 1 so 
	# computer_choice will 0, 1, or 2 chosen at random.
	...Fill in your code here ...
	</code>
	</pre>
