This works like a halfway point between typing programs into Visual Studio Code and typing them directly into to REPL.  Many data scientists find Jupyter Notebooks to be the sweet spot for the way they code.  They can combine the code they write with the output in a single file and then export that file to a PDF file or a webpage to share with others.  It also is easier to run small bits of code or create simple functions without having all the overhead of a full python program.  \n",
