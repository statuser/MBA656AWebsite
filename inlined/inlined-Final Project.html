    <p>Your assignment is to prepare a report that summarizes the findings in the previously collected survey.  You will have 15 minutes to present your results.  The survey is fairly short.  Do not feel the need to fill all 15 minutes if the data does not warrant that.  The most important learning from this assignment is to understand the core business problem that to be addressed and finding a solution using the data provided.</p>
    <p>In keeping with the topics in the course, please you Python for the data analysis.  There are many other tools available that are useful and helpful including analytics built into Qualtrics.  For the purposes of this assignment please use Python however. (The main exception is that sometimes I find it best to use the visualization tools built into the presentation software for the final visualizations.</p>
    <p>Make sure your presentation includes the following:</p>
    <ul class="checklist" style="list-style: none;margin-left: 0;padding-left: 1.2em;text-indent: -1.2em">
      <li>A statement of the business question that motivated the project</li>
      <li>The answer to that business question</li>
      <li>Visualizations and data summaries to support your solution</li>
      <li>Conclusions and expected results</li>
      <li>Appendix with data and code</li>
    </ul>
	<p>The data files you will need for your project can be found at:
	  </p>
<ul>
	  	<li>PROVIDE LINK - Survey Proposal</li>
		<li>PROVIDE LINK - Survey as recorded in a .txt printout</li>
		<li>PROVIDE LINK - .csv file of survey results.</li>
