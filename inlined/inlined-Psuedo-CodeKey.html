    <ol style="steplist">
      <li>Step 1 - Play the game ones or twice to really understand the rules.  If you aren't able to play the game 
        find a video online about how the game is played. </li>
      <li> Step 2 - Identify what problems we are going to solve and what features we are not going to implement.
        <ul>
          <li>We will be creating one players experience with playing TENZI.  We will not create multiple players that race each other</li>
          <li>We are only going to solve one round of the game.  We are not going to keep score or consider alternative versions</li>
          <li>We are only going to play the default version of the game.  We will not be playing any of the variations</li>
          <li>We are not going to stop if somebody else shouts 'TENZI'.  We will just continue until we complete the TENZI and handle who wins separately</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Step 3 - Write down what steps you take when you play the game
        <ol>
          <li>Pick up ten dice</li>
          <li>Once go is said roll the dice</li>
          <li>Find which number has the highest count - This is the target number
            <ul>
              <li>If there is a tie in the counts of two numbers pick the target number randomly</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Pick up the remaining dice and roll again</li>
          <li>Pull out the matching dice</li>
          <li>If the saved pile has 10 dice in it shout "TENZI"</li>
          <li>Repeat steps 4-6 until:
            <ul>
              <li>You shout "TENZI" or</li>
              <li>Somebody else "TENZI"</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If you shout "TENZI" you win - gloat and rub it in the other players faces</li>
          <li>If somebody else shouts "TENZI" you lose - pout and vow to never play games again</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
<li>Step 4 - Identify what needs to be stored in memory for the previous steps
        <ol>
          <li>A list of all ten dice and the value for each one</li>
          <li>A value showing the target number</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Step 5 - Combine steps 3 and 4 into psuedo-code.  The closer we make it to computer language the 
        less work we have to do latter.  It is sometimes worth it to refine our psuedo-code multiple times</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Try one:</p>
    <pre>
	<code>
	Initialize dice - a 10 item list with initial values set to 0
	Wait for "GO" (This could be an input with 
		something like "Press any key to start")
	Roll each die - We will need to fill in additional details 
		on how to do this.  (Maybe a function?)
	Find which number has the maximum occurances - This is also 
			more complicated can we find a function to do this for us?
		If there is a tie take the lowest number
	Set target_number to maximum in previous step
	dice_to_reroll = number of dice not equal to the target number
	while dice_to_reroll &gt; 0
		Reroll the die excluding those that have 
			the value of the target number
		dice_to_reroll = number of dice not equal to target number
	Print("TENZI")
	</code>
	</pre>
    <p> OK it looks like we need to fill in a few details and maybe do a little bit of research.  We probably 
      need to write a separate script to roll the dice.  A single bit of code should do the trick here.</p>
    <p>We also need to figure out which number has the highest count.  A quick Google search of "Python find the 
      maximum occurance of an item in a list" yields this page: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6987285/python-find-the-item-with-maximum-occurrences-in-a-list">Stackoverflow 
      - Python- find the item with maximum occurrences in a list</a> With answer 2 we can just use default python without any libraries so that seems like and easy problem to solve.</p>
    <p>The last issue is that we need to figure out how many numbers match our target number.  A Google search seems to be a good solution here.  I searched
      for "python find how many times an item appears in a list" and got this result: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2600191/how-can-i-count-the-occurrences-of-a-list-item">StackOverflow -
      How can I count the occurrences of a list item?</a></p>
    <p>This leads to the following code:</p>
    <pre>
	<code>
	import random

	def roll(dice_list, keep_number=None):
		for index, die in enumerate(dice_list):
			if keep_number is None or die != keep_number:
				dice_list[index] = random.choice(range(1,7))
		return dice_list

	dice = [None]*10
	input("Press enter to start")
	dice = roll(dice)
	print(dice)
	target_number = max(dice, key=dice.count) # Automatically resolves ties
	dice_to_reroll = 10 - dice.count(target_number)
	while dice_to_reroll &gt; 0:
		dice = roll(dice, target_number)
		dice_to_reroll = 10 - dice.count(target_number)
	print(dice)
	print("TENZI")
	</code>
	  </pre>
